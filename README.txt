App Name - Anakin Skywalker
NLP Fall 2016 Final Project 

This is a web interface for our NLP final project. Users can enter their tweet and the application will display the sentiment towards Hillary or Trump.

Please note: Due to our model limitations and our training based on actual tweets, please ensure that the text you enter mimics an actual tweet during the election cycle. Simple text might not work since they are not representative of the way users tweet.

Running the app:
- Ensure that your system has Python3 installed
- navigate to the project directory in your terminal
- enter the following command: python run.py
- Go to your web browser and enter the url localhost:5000
- Enjoy!
